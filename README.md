# Pygmalion

Because we're all perverts on the inside (and outside) ! Use 'Zero' to have a simple yet quite elegant style for Danbooru.

What's an userstyle ?
-------------------------------

Simply put, it's a script with a bunch of pseudo-code that will change the aspect of any website, it's kind like make-up I guess : you'll be able to change/modify the visual of the elements of the page (background, icon, buttons, etc...) and even delete some useless stuff. To use it, there is an add-on called 'Stylish' for the majority of the browser, so if you are on Chrome, Firefox, Opera and such go for it ! I also recommend you to go to userstyles.org (userstyles.org/) where you can found a lot of styles for a lot of website.

What do 'Pygmalion' change ?
-------------------------------

 If you're looking for a simple and cool theme for 4chan, you should give this script a try, here what you'll have :
- in general, we have a fucking banner again, but who doesn't like banner, right ? And of course, if you don't like the one I used you'll be able to change it by modifying the value of 'background-image' in /** GENERAL/BANNER/CUSTOM **/ (I added custom banner for the board I go to frequently, you can find them at the end of the script), with this the board's title and the index buttons were changed and moved in the banner section, the default blue/green/whatever background was changed for a light grey, I chnaged the color of the navbar (I do think it looks sexier now), the real banners of 4chan were removed (I do like them tho, just don't know where to place them so I removed them), also the search bar is no more because F3 is superior imo, same situation for the 'bottom', return', 'resfresh' buttons .
- in the catalog, the description (ie meta, subject, teaser, etc) are more visible with a white background, the dropdown icon is now always visible because it adds more element and it'll be easier to hide/watch/report/archive/etc a specific thread, the arhive button was removed because I don't use this shit, and what's more the OP's picture of a thread in your watchlist will be darken.
- in the paged/infinite threads/all threads, nothing too fancy, wanted to have the same 'design' as the others pages, only thing I can mention is the fact that I removed the minimize icon in the reply posts, but kept it for each thread.
- in the thread, changed the colors of the user's name, the time, the number, the quotelink, etc to make it more modern I guess, plus for dubs/trips/quads/etc there will be 'check' icon(s) (I copy/paste the code made by commit-sudoku from the script called 'Zairyou', https://github.com/commit-sudoku/zairyou, I also borrowed the code for the notifications), other than that the post who quote you will have a blue border on the left, and your post will have a red border on the left, the last post you saw will have a black border at the top. The 'top' button was replaced by an icon (the same as tumblr) and will scroll with the page. The quick reply wasn't changed (I didn't have any ideas for it), just plain white.

How to install it ?
-------------------------------

After installing 'Stylish', you'll have to 'write a new style', copy/paste the code in 'pygmalion.css', name the style and then save ! Before installing it, I suggest you :

- (THIS IS IMPORTANT) this script will work perfectly if you install 4chan X (github.com/ccd0/4chan-x) and OneeChan (github.com/Nebukazar/OneeChan), this won't be a difficult task to do, you'll only have to click some buttons. After that (because it's not finished unfortunately), you'll have to import two scripts, one for 4chan X and the other for OneeChan, you'll be able to download them in this link : mega:#F!958lRB7C!HZKGTiGsDpBmazca5v7JMA. To import them, for the first one (ie 4chanX), click on the navbar the 'spanner' icon which represents 4chanX Settings, then click import and select the file in question; for the second one (ie OneeChan), click on the navbar the 'gears' icon which represents OneeChan Settings, then click import and select the second file. And finally, don't close OneeChan Settings and click the 'Themes' tab : select the the 'Edit' button when you hover the 'Muted Seaweed' theme and change the value of each parts to match the ones in the following picture (i.imgur.com/i46e8Gc.png).
- to install the font I used, namely 'Roboto' (https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto) and if you want Meiryo, all of them are free so don't be shy.
- download Adblock Plus to kill the ads

Where can I find your works ?
