About
-------------------------------

Pygmalion-Z is a custom stylesheet for 4chan.

A custom stylesheet (or userstyles) is a script with a bunch of pseudo-code that will change the aspect of any website, it's kind like make-up I guess : you'll be able to change/modify the visual of the elements of the page (background, icon, buttons, etc...) and even delete some useless stuff.

Instruction
-------------------------------

<strong>Step 1 : Install Stylish</strong> 

<span>Depending of your browser.</span>
<ol>
<li>for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>
<li>for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en">Google Chrome</a></li>
<li>for <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylish/">Opera</a></li>
<li>for <a href="http://sobolev.us/stylish/">Safari</a></li>
<li> for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.pmmlabs.stylish&amp;hl=en">Dolphin</a></li>
</ol>

<strong>Step 2 : Install the script </strong>
<ol>
<li> Via <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/144764/pygmalion-z-4chan-css">userstyles</a> : click the button <i>install Style</i> and it's done.</li>
<li> Or <a href="https://pastebin.com/EPjYX3yH">manually</a> : create a new style in Stylish and copy/paste the script in it. The script was written for Firefox Mozilla, that's why for Google Chrome and such, you'll have to click the button <i>Import from Mozilla.</i></li>
</ol>

<strong> Step 3 : Install plugins and scripts </strong>
<ol>
<li>First, install <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey</a> (for Mozilla Firefox) or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en">Tampermonkey</a> (for Google Chrome) </li>
<li>Second, install <a href="https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x">4chan-x</a> and <a href="github.com/Nebukazar/OneeChan">OneeChan</a></li>
<li>Import in 4chan-X and OneeChan settings the files you'll find in this <a href="https://mega.nz/#F!kO4igYiY!xWataLIzufNPuqw0W0t73g">link</a></li>
</ol>

<strong>Step 4 : Install the font </strong> 

I use several fonts for my custom stylesheet.
<ol>
<li> <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto">Roboto</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://mega.nz/#F!x0kEyB6Q!wlyJiWObHX4U9oSW7IRgmA">Proxima Nova</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://www.freejapanesefont.com/bokutachi-gothic-2-bold/">Bokutachi no Gothic 2 </a></li>
<li> <a href="http://www.freejapanesefont.com/kf-himaji/">KFHimaji</a></li>
</ol>

<strong>Step 5 : Show your appreciation </strong>
<ol>
<li>Feel free to comment this submission (critique, suggestion, compliment, etc).</li>
<li>If you like my works, don't hesitate to watch me.</li>
<li>You can share it, but don't forget to mention me.</li>
</ol>

Trivia
-------------------------------

I decided to name the script <i>Pygmalion-Z</i> because the mascot of 4chan Yotsuba is a little girl with green hair holding a clover, it reminds me of the famous play Pygmalion and the flower Girl Eliza Doolittle (not as cute as Yotsuba). The <i>Z</i> makes it cooler, like those series where they put a Z to the original title for the second season.

Report
-------------------------------

This script isn't perfect, some parts of the site weren't modified such as the section in Shop or the F.A.Q section. If you find some elements that weren't tweaked or that you simply want to modify or re-add an element that was removed, don't hesitate to report it in the comments.
